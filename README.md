# Adaptive cruise control system based on model predictive control
Implementing a Model Predictive Control (MPC) method on an Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) system. A vehicle moves at a constant speed, and a following vehicle approaches the leading vehicle and should maintain the same speed. By using an MPC controller, the desired stability and target speed of the leading vehicle are achieved under specified input constraints. Through simulations in MATLAB, it is shown that the proposed MPC strategy can keep the vehicle within the specified constraints.
